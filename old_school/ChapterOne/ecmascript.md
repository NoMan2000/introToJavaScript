# EcmaScript

EcmaScript is what's known as a `meta-language`.  A `meta-language` is not an actual programming language, but a set of specifications for how a programming language should behave.

Each Javascript engine has levels of compliance with different EcmaScript standards.  We will be covering EcmaScript 5.1, which is the version that has the highest level of support in most modern browsers.  [Can I use](http://www.caniuse.com) lists what features are supported in which browsers.

You can create an EcmaScript compliant language that is not JavaScript.  ActionScript is probably the most well-known EcmaScript language that isn't JavaScript.  You can also add features that are not part of the standard and still be EcmaScript complaint, so long as you do implement the features that are part of the language.
